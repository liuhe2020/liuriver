                <p>Hello, my name is Liu and I am thrilled to tell you a little bit about myself. My passion for photography came at an early age. My dad was a photography enthusiast. Growing up, he took every opportunity to document our lives through photos. When I was 10 years old, he gave me an old film camera, taught me everything I needed to know about film and I have never stopped since.
                </p>
                <br>
                Photography has always been an integral part of my life and has led me to many adventures. The most memorable ones off the top of my head were swimming with the whale sharks in the Philippines, climbing an active volcano in Guatemala and freezing my butt off in Norway chasing the elusive northern lights.
                </p>
                <br>
                At about a decade ago, I got a job in a theatre in the West End of London. Soon after that I started taking photos of aspiring actors who worked in the theatre in between their acting jobs. Over time, I got a knack for getting my subjects to shine in my photos through interaction and developed my own unique style. Today, I strive to take the best photos that you have ever been photographed to help you get to the next stage.
